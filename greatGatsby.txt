Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, 
moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses 
began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for 
Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that 
had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all 
human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of 
this continent, compelled into an æsthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to 
face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.
